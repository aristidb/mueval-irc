Mueval is a code evaluator for Haskell; it employs the GHC API (as provided by the Hint library). It uses a variety of techniques to evaluate arbitrary Haskell expressions safely & securely. Since it was begun in June 2008, tremendous progress has been made; it is currently used in Lambdabot live in #haskell). Mueval can also be called from the command-line.

Mueval features:
\begin{compactitem}
\item A comprehensive test-suite of expressions which should and shouldn't work
\item Defeats all known attacks
\item Optional resource limits and module imports
\item The ability to load in definitions from a specified file
\item Parses Haskell expressions with haskell-src-exts and tests against black- and white-lists
\item A process-level watchdog, to work around past and future GHC issues with thread-level watchdogs.
\item Cabalized
\end{compactitem}
We are currently working on the following:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Refactoring modules to render Mueval more useful as a library
\item Removing the POSIX-only requirement
\end{compactitem}
